## 2026-02-05 — Initial Setup Session

Created `CLAUDE.md` project guide, performed full codebase audit confirming all Python source is complete (`cli.py`, `client.py`, `database.py`, `scraper.py`), identified missing infrastructure (no Python runtime, no `.env`, no `data/` directories, hardcoded Mac paths in `daily_scrape.sh`), added methodology log, and established `.gitignore` whitelist pattern for project docs.
